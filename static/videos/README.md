# Video Demonstrations

This directory is intended to store recorded and edited video demonstrations for the capstone projects and key concepts within the book.

## How to use this directory:

1.  **Record Videos**: Based on the plans and scripts in `video_demonstrations_plan.md`, record the simulation runs in NVIDIA Isaac Sim (or other relevant environments).
2.  **Edit Videos**: Edit the raw footage, add voiceovers, annotations, and any necessary post-production to create high-quality demonstration videos.
3.  **Store Videos**: Place the final video files (e.g., `.mp4`, `.webm`) directly in this `static/videos/` directory.
4.  **Embed in Documentation**: Reference these video files in the relevant chapters of the Docusaurus documentation using Markdown or MDX syntax (e.g., `<video controls src="/videos/my_demo.mp4" width="640" height="360"></video>`).

*(This is a manual task that requires human intervention.)*
