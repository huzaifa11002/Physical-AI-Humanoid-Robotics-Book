# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book.

## Terms

**Physical AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that operate and interact directly within the physical world, using sensors to perceive and actuators to act.

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: An open-source middleware suite for robot software development, providing tools, libraries, and conventions for building complex robotic systems.

**Gazebo**: A powerful 3D robot simulator that allows for testing and refining robotic creations in a virtual environment.

**Unity**: A real-time 3D development platform used for creating interactive experiences, including robotics simulations.

**NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: A scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool built on NVIDIA Omniverse, designed for developing and testing AI-powered robots.

**VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A technology enabling robots to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously tracking their own location within it, primarily using visual sensor data.

**Nav2**: The ROS 2 Navigation Stack, a modular framework for autonomous robot navigation, providing tools for path planning, obstacle avoidance, and localization.

**Whisper**: An open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI, capable of transcribing audio into text and translating languages.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding, generating, and processing human language.

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML file format in ROS that describes a robot's kinematic and dynamic properties, visual appearance, and collision model.

**SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: An XML file format used in Gazebo to describe robots, environments, and other objects in a simulation.

**MDX (Markdown with JSX)**: An extension of Markdown that allows embedding JSX components directly within Markdown documents, commonly used in Docusaurus.

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**: A set of practices that enable rapid and reliable software delivery by automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

**WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**: A set of guidelines for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. Level AA is a common target for compliance.
